# About
The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering ([OUSD R&E](https://www.cto.mil/)) inspired by DARPA's [Cyber Grand Challenge](https://www.darpa.mil/program/cyber-grand-challenge) is kicking off a series of challenges to tackle some of the hardest shared challenges public, private and academic sectors face via  "micro-challenges". The goals of these "micro-challenges" are to produce a community contributed set of forensic tools or unique data sets that can be transitioned back into one's day job, academic research, etc...

The first of these events for 2023 is “Ghidra Golf”, and will be hosted at ShmooCon, January 20th through January 23rd.

# Ghidra Golf Overview
Ghidra Golf is reverse engineering/forensics Capture The Flag event with focus on Ghidra Script development.
The contestant's goal in addition to solving traditional reverse engineering challenges is to develop Ghidra Scripts to identify, parse, decrypt/decode or otherwise accomplish a specific reverse engineering task. Contestants are provided with a binary to download, reverse engineer and to test their code against, before submitting their Ghidra Script for evaluation. 

Selected contestant submitted Ghidra Scripts will be compiled into a centralized [Github Repository](https://github.com/ghidragolf/ghidra_scripts) under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
Attribution will be given to the author via the "@author" javadoc.
