      <h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (<a href="https://www.cto.mil/">OUSD R&amp;E</a>) inspired by DARPA’s <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/cyber-grand-challenge">Cyber Grand Challenge</a> is kicking off a series of challenges to to tackle some of the hardest shared challenges public, private and academic sectors face via  “micro-challenges”. Micro-challenges are being stood up at a variety of conferences including <a href="https://shmoocon.org/">ShmooCon</a> and BSides conferences. The goals of these “micro-challenges” are to produce a community contributed set of forensic tools or unique data sets that can be transitioned back into one’s day job, academic research, etc…</p>

<p>The first of these events for 2023 is “Ghidra Golf”, and will be hosted at ShmooCon, January 20th through January 23rd.
